<h1>AWS SDK for Android (Beta) Readme</h1>
<p>The  AWS SDK for Android provides a library, code samples, and documentation for  developers to build connected mobile applications using AWS. This guide walks through the steps for setting up the SDK and running one of the samples.Â </p>
<h2>About the SDK</h2>
<p>The AWS SDK for Android includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Libraries</strong>- Build Android applications on top of APIs  that take the complexity out of coding directly against a web service  interface. The libraries provide APIs that hide much of the lower-level  plumbing, including authentication, request retries, and error  handling. Each service has its own library, so you can use only the  services you need and keep your application size as small as possible. </li>
  <li> <strong>Code Samples</strong>- Practical examples for how to use the library to build applications. </li>
  <li> <strong>Documentation</strong>- Complete reference documentation demonstrating how to use the SDK. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Get Set Up</h2>
<p>To get set up, you must sign up for Amazon Web Services, get  your AWS credentials, and set up your environment.</p>
<h3>Sign Up for AWS Products</h3>
<p>Before you can begin, you must sign up for each AWS product you want  to use. The sample we'll cover in this guide uses both Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon S3, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS, so you'll need to sign up for all four products.</p>
<strong>To sign up for a product</strong>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Go to       the home page for the product, for example <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">aws.amazon.com/s3/</a>. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/products">aws.amazon.com/products</a> for a list of links to all our products.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>Click the       sign-up button on the top right corner of the page. </li>
  <li>Follow  the on-screen instructions. If you don't already have an AWS account,  you are prompted to create one as part of the sign-up process.</li>
</ol>
<p>AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is  complete. You can view your current account activity or manage your  account at any time, by going to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</a> and clicking the <strong>Account</strong> tab.</p>
<h3>Get Your Credentials</h3>
<p>In order to use the AWS SDK for Android, you need your AWS  Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.</p>
<strong>To get your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key </strong>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Account</strong> and then click <strong>Security Credentials</strong>.<br />
    The Security Credentials page displays (you might be prompted to log in).</li>
  <li>Scroll       down to Access Credentials and make sure the <strong>Access Keys</strong> tab is selected.<br />
    The AWS Access Key ID appears in the Access Key column.</li>
  <li>To view       the Secret Access Key, click <strong>Show</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important!</strong> Your Secret Access Key  is a secret, which only you and AWS should know. It is important to  keep it confidential to protect your account. Store it securely in a  safe place. Never include it in your requests to AWS, and never email  it to anyone. Do not share it outside your organization, even if an  inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon.com. No one who legitimately  represents Amazon will ever ask you for your Secret Access Key.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Get the Android SDK</h3>
<p>Downlod the SDK from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid">http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid</a>.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for using the AWS SDK for Android are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requires Android 2.1 (API Level 7) or higher. For more information on the Android SDK, see <a href="http://developer.android.com">developer.android.com</a>. </li>
  <li>To run the sample in this guide, you also need <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html">Android Development Tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
